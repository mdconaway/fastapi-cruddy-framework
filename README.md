## About Cruddy Framework

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/mdconaway/fastapi-cruddy-framework)

`fastapi-cruddy-framework` is a companion library to [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) designed to bring the development productivity of [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/) or [Sails.js](https://sailsjs.com/) to the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) ecosystem. Many of the design patterns base themselves on [Sails.js](https://sailsjs.com/) "policies," [Sails.js](https://sailsjs.com/) model lifecycle events, [sails-ember-rest](https://github.com/mdconaway/sails-ember-rest) automatic CRUD routing, and [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/) [REST-Adapter](https://api.emberjs.com/ember-data/release/classes/RESTAdapter) feature sets. By default, data sent to and from the auto-magic CRUD routes are expected to conform to the [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/) Rest Envelope and Linked-data relationship specification. This specification is highly readable for front-end developers, allows for an expressive over-the-wire query syntax, and embeds self-describing relationship URL links in each over-the-wire record to help data stores automatically generate requests to fetch or update related records. This library is still in an alpha/beta phase, so use at your own risk. All CRUD actions and relationship types are currently supported, though there may be unexpected bugs. Please report any bugs under "issues."

TODO: Additional documentation and tests. (General features covered by tests) Maybe more comments. Maybe more features.

See the examples folder for a quick reference of high level setup. It currently contains a fully functional fastapi server which uses fastapi-cruddy-framework and the sqlite adapter. It even shows how to override incoming post data to do things like hash a user's password during initial registration using a simple drop-in policy function.

Come for the websocket manager, stay for the CRUD!

<!-- CreateRouterFromResources -->

### CreateRouterFromResources

This instance factory creates and returns a fully-wired fastapi `APIRouter` which sub-routes all `Resource` instances created in your project. Theoretically, you can create and mount multiple routers this way, but each router needs to be provided all of the `Resource` instances required to fully resolve the relationships it may care about. The recommended way to structure your project is to keep all resources required for a route set contained within a single folder. This factory is then provided the relative path to a resource set folder, starting with your application's `main` module, and will return the fully interconnected route set while also instantiating all of your resource modules. Typically, it is a good idea to import all of your router instances in your main module, as they will need to be "connected" to your fastapi server <i>WITHIN</i> the `startup` hook. This is critical, as the resource registry (discussed below) cannot fully resolve relationships until after SQLAlchemy is aware of all models. This occurs in-between launching your main module and the `startup` hook.

Example:

```python
import my_app
from fastapi_cruddy_framework import CreateRouterFromResources
from fastapi import FastAPI, APIRouter


my_router: APIRouter = CreateRouterFromResources(
    # (REQUIRED) application_module is of "ModuleType" type, and should be a pointer to your main app module
    application_module=my_app,
    # (OPTIONAL) resource_path is of "str" type, and should specify a relative path from application_module
    # to the location of your "resources" that will be auto-loaded and bundled under this router
    # tree.
    resource_path="resources",
    # (OPTIONAL) common_resource_name is of "str" type, and should describe the common export value in each
    # resource file where the router factory can find your "Resource" instances. Use this if you want to name
    # all of your resource objects something other than "resource"
    common_resource_name="resource"
)

app = FastAPI(title="My App", version="1")

@app.on_event("startup")
async def bootstrap():
  app.include_router(my_router)

# fin!
```

<!-- Resource -->

### Resource

The `Resource` class is the fundamental building block of fastapi-cruddy-framework. Your resource instances define the union of your models, resource "controller" (which is a fastapi router with baked-in CRUD logic), business policies, repository abstraction layer, any resource lifecycle hook, and database adapter. Fortunately for you, the user, everything is essentially ready-to-go out of the box. Like [sails-ember-rest](https://github.com/mdconaway/sails-ember-rest) or [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), you can now focus all of your development time on creating reusable policies (which contain your business logic that lies just above your CRUD endpoints), defining your models, and extending your resource controllers to add one-off actions like "login" or "change password". Lifecycle actions allow you to alter query configurations or record data before or after it is persisted to a database, or perform some other task before replying to the user. All of your resources should be loaded by the router factory (above) to ensure that relationships and routes are resolved in the correct order. Don't forget, <b>only plug the master router into your application in the fastapi `startup`Â hook!</b>

<b>Resource Nuances:</b>

- Defining your policies is done at definition time!
- Lifecycle actions occur immediately before and after any database interaction your CRUD controllers make
- Lifecycle actions passed into the Resource constructor to interact with your queries or data <b>MUST</b> be `async` functions.
- Policies are run in the exact order in which they are included in the `list` sent to the resource definition.
- `policies_universal` apply to ALL CRUD routes, and always run <i>BEFORE</i> action specific policy chains.
- Action specific policies run <i>AFTER</i> all `policies_universal` have resolved successfully.
- Each endpoint is protected by `policies_universal` + `policies_<action>`.
- One-to-Many and Many-to-Many sub-routes (like /users/{id}/posts) will be protected by the policy chain: `user.policies_universal` + `user.policies_get_one` + `posts.policies_get_many`. Security, security, security!
- Blocking user REST modification of certain relationships via the default CRUD controller is also done at definition time!
- `protected_relationships`, `protected_create_relationships` and `protected_update_relationships` are `list[str]` types with each string indicating a one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many relationship that should not be allowed to create or update via the default CRUD actions. (protected_relationships alone blocks BOTH)
- You should define your application-wide adapter elsewhere and pass it into the resource instance.
- Resources cannot span different databases.

<b>Available Policy Chain Definitions:</b>

- `policies_universal`
- `policies_create`
- `policies_update`
- `policies_delete`
- `policies_get_one`
- `policies_get_many`

<b>Available ASYNC Repository Level Lifecycle Hooks:</b>

- `lifecycle_before_create`
- `lifecycle_after_create`
- `lifecycle_before_update`
- `lifecycle_after_update`
- `lifecycle_before_delete`
- `lifecycle_after_delete`
- `lifecycle_before_get_one`
- `lifecycle_after_get_one`
- `lifecycle_before_get_all`
- `lifecycle_after_get_all`
- `lifecycle_before_set_relations`
- `lifecycle_after_set_relations`

<b>Available ASYNC Controller Level Lifecycle Hooks:</b>

- `lifecycle_before_controller_create`
- `lifecycle_after_controller_create`
- `lifecycle_before_controller_update`
- `lifecycle_after_controller_update`
- `lifecycle_before_controller_delete`
- `lifecycle_after_controller_delete`
- `lifecycle_before_controller_get_one`
- `lifecycle_after_controller_get_one`
- `lifecycle_before_controller_get_all`
- `lifecycle_after_controller_get_all`

<b>Available Relationship Blocks:</b>

- `protected_relationships`
- `protected_create_relationships`
- `protected_update_relationships`

<b>Updating Relationships:</b>

- You can update relationships via either CREATE or UPDATE actions against each base resource!

As you will discover, your resource's create and update models will automatically gain "shadow" properties where one-to-many and many-to-many relationships exist. These properties expect a client to send a list of IDs that specify the foreign records that relate to the target record. So - if a user is a member of many groups, and a group can have many users, you could update the users in a group by sending a property `"users": [1,2,3,4,5]` within the `group` payload object you send to the `POST /groups` or `PATCH /groups` routes/actions. It will all be clear when you look at the SWAGGER docs generated for your API.

<b>Repository Lifecycle hooks</b>

The following lifecycle hook methods, which can be defined in user-space code, receive the following information from fastapi-cruddy-framework:

`lifecycle_before_create` - Record without an ID. Values altered on this record in the lifecycle hook will be persisted to the DB.

`lifecycle_after_create` - Record with an ID, as returned from the database.

`lifecycle_before_update` - A key-values dictionary to be applied to the database, and the primary key id of the record which will be updated. Values altered in the dictionary will be applied to the DB update.

`lifecycle_after_update` - Record with an ID, as returned from the database

`lifecycle_before_delete` - Record with an ID, as returned from the database.

`lifecycle_after_delete` - Record with an ID, as returned from the database. This record no longer exists in the database.

`lifecycle_before_get_one` - A primary key value that will be used to fetch the record from the database, and a secondary where filter if one was used.

`lifecycle_after_get_one` - Record with an ID, as returned from the database.

`lifecycle_before_get_all` - Recieves a query configuration object. Any user-space modifications to this object will impact the query made by fastapi-cruddy-framework. This method is also invoked when a foreign Resource queries a relationship that affects the Resource where you plug in this hook.

`lifecycle_after_get_all` - Receives a BulkDTO object, containing the database objects retrieved by a get_all query, as well as the query metadata. This method is also invoked when a foreign Resource queries a relationship that affects the Resource where you plug in this hook.

`lifecycle_before_set_relations` - Receives a relationship configuration object which containts information about the record id affected, the relationship being altered, and the new list of relations for this relationship type.

```
{
    "id": id, # The database id whos relationship are about to be altered (of your defined PK type)
    "relation": relation, # The relationship that is about to change (string)
    "relations": relations # An array of foreign ids, or record dictionaries that will now define this relationship (Framework will attempt to discard old relations)
}
```

`lifecycle_after_set_relations` - Receives a completed mapping of the affected relational change, which can be used to echo changes to other databases or services.

```
{
    "model": model, # The CruddyModel affected by this relationship change
    "relation_conf": relation_conf, # The configuration object from lifecycle_before_set_relations
    "relation_type": MANYTOMANY, # An SQL Alchemy relationship-type identifier (MANYTOMANY or ONETOMANY)
    "related_table": foreign_table, # The table that ultimately represents the far-side of this relationship (not the join table!)
    "related_field": field_name, # The field on the related_table that represents the far side of the relationship
    "updated_db_count": result # The number of records now in the database associated with this relationship. If the number is different than the length of relation_conf.relations, you probably have a non-nullable field on the far-side of this relationship.
}
```

<b>Controller Lifecycle hooks</b>

The following lifecycle hook methods, which can be defined in user-space code, receive the following information from fastapi-cruddy-framework:

`lifecycle_before_controller_create` - request (a FastAPI Request), context (A mutable action context dictionary)

`lifecycle_after_controller_create` - request (a FastAPI Request), context (A mutable action context dictionary)

`lifecycle_before_controller_update` - request (a FastAPI Request), context (A mutable action context dictionary)

`lifecycle_after_controller_update` - request (a FastAPI Request), context (A mutable action context dictionary)

`lifecycle_before_controller_delete` - request (a FastAPI Request), context (A mutable action context dictionary)

`lifecycle_after_controller_delete` - request (a FastAPI Request), context (A mutable action context dictionary)

`lifecycle_before_controller_get_one` - request (a FastAPI Request), context (A mutable action context dictionary)

`lifecycle_after_controller_get_one` - request (a FastAPI Request), context (A mutable action context dictionary)

`lifecycle_before_controller_get_all` - request (a FastAPI Request), context (A mutable action context dictionary)

`lifecycle_after_controller_get_all` - request (a FastAPI Request), context (A mutable action context dictionary)

Below is an example for creating a `user` resource. The best way to organize your app would be to place the definition for your user resource in a folder like `my_app/resources/user.py`, where the name of your application is `my_app`. As you saw earlier in the description for `CreateRouterFromResources` you would then load this user resource file by simply specifying `application_module=my_app` and `resource_path="resources"`. Your `fastapi-cruddy-framework` project would then auto-magically load your resource file(s), create dynamic routes to create, read, update, and delete this resource, and further create sub-routes within this resource to browse, query and update all of the relationships for your resource.

Example:

```python
from fastapi_cruddy_framework import Resource, UUID
from my_app.adapters import sqlite
from my_app.models.user import (
    User,
    UserCreate,
    UserUpdate,
    UserView,
)
from my_app.schemas.response import MetaObject
from my_app.policies.verify_session import verify_session
from my_app.policies.hash_user_password import (
    hash_user_password,
)


resource = Resource(
    id_type=UUID,
    adapter=sqlite,
    resource_update_model=UserUpdate,
    resource_create_model=UserCreate,
    resource_model=User,
    response_schema=UserView,
    response_meta_schema=MetaObject,
    protected_relationships=["posts"],
    policies_universal=[verify_session],
    policies_create=[hash_user_password]
)

# fin!
```

Easy, right?

<!-- ResourceRegistry -->

### ResourceRegistry

The `ResourceRegistry` class should be invisible to the average user. There are no input parameters when creating a registry, and by default Cruddy defines its own library-internal registry. The registry exists to perform the following functions:

- Maintain a map of all resources available to `fastapi-cruddy-framework`
- Trigger `resolve` for all resources after SQL Alchemy finishes computing the relationship properties on each SQLModel.
- Plugin to the `Resource` class, so that each `Resource` you define can automatically call `ResourceRegistry.register()` when you define it. This is all "under the hood".

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- CruddyResourceRegistry -->

### CruddyResourceRegistry

The `CruddyResourceRegistry` is a framework-created instance of the `ResourceRegistry` class, exposed as an export so that application builders can acquire framework component instance references dynamically. It manages all of the resources and other subordinate components the active Cruddy framework is aware of. This framework internal registry instance is extremely helpful for looking up resource, controller, and model classes and instances <i>without</i> causing a litany of circular import issues in app code. Due to the asynchronous nature of how cruddy framework must initialize, application developers should use the `CruddyResourceRegistry` to "lookup" objects in any app code that needs to use a fully functional framework instance. What's a good example of where this is useful? Acquiring a resource's repository instance from within a policy so you can run database checks <i>before</i> a CRUD action occurs. There are many other applicable scenarios. See example, below.

```python
# This is an example policy file that could live in your project at policies/load_user_into_session.py
from fastapi import Request
from fastapi_cruddy_framework import AbstractRepository, CruddyResourceRegistry, BulkDTO

async def load_user_into_session(request: Request):
    some_value = "that identifies a user"
    user_repository: AbstractRepository = CruddyResourceRegistry.get_repository_by_name(model_name="User")
    repo_dto: BulkDTO = await user_repository.get_all(limit=1, where={"some_field": some_value})
    if len(repo_dto.data) == 0:
        raise Exception("User not found!")
    request.session.update({"user": repo_dto.data.pop()})
```

The available registry lookup function signatures are:

- `get_model_by_name(model_name: str) -> CruddyModel | None]`
- `get_relationships_by_name(model_name: str) -> dict | None`
- `get_resource_by_name(model_name: str) -> Resource | None`
- `get_repository_by_name(model_name: str) -> AbstractRepository | None`
- `get_controller_by_name(model_name: str) -> APIRouter | None`
- `get_controller_extension_by_name(model_name: str) -> CruddyController | None`

Make sure that the `model_name` string you pass to the registry EXACTLY mirrors the class name for your base table `CruddyModel`. So for a model with a class of `User` you would pass in `model_name="User"`. Pay attention to the capitalization!

<!-- Actions -->

### Actions

The `Actions` class contains all the business logic for the <i>base</i> CRUD actions that are wired into a controller's route tree based on the framework options used. Each resource / controller will generate its own unique CRUD actions instance, and make this object available to user-space `CruddyController` instance, which are described in more detail below. Actions that are deferred from routing automatically (using option flags such as `disable_create`) are still generated for reach resource's actions map, which makes those functions available in the `CruddyController` setup function.

Available actions:

```python
async def create(data: create_model)

async def update(id: id_type = Path(..., alias="id"), *, data: update_model)

async def delete(
    id: id_type = Path(..., alias="id"),
)

async def get_by_id(
    id: id_type = Path(..., alias="id"),
    where: Json = Query(None, alias="where"),
)

async def get_all(
    page: int = 1,
    limit: int = 10,
    columns: list[str] = Query(None, alias="columns"),
    sort: list[str] = Query(None, alias="sort"),
    where: Json = Query(None, alias="where"),
)
```

You can re-use CRUD actions in your controllers as follows:

```python
from pydantic.types import Json
from fastapi_cruddy_framework import CruddyController
from fastapi import Query, Path, HTTPException, status
from fastapi_cruddy_framework import CruddyController
from examples.fastapi_cruddy_sqlite.policies.verify_session import verify_session
from examples.fastapi_cruddy_sqlite.utils.dependency_list import dependency_list


class UserController(CruddyController):
    def setup(self):
        # You can extend controller actions here!
        # You can also access:
        # self.actions
        # self.resource
        # self.repository
        # self.adapter
        # self.controller
        id_type = self.resource._id_type
        many_schema = self.resource.schemas["many"]

        # You can tap into the controller's CRUD actions map in the following ways:
        # 1. Override the action key
        old_delete = self.actions.delete

        async def new_delete(id: id_type = Path(..., alias="id"), confirm: str = "N"):
            if confirm == "Y":
                return await old_delete(id=id)
            else:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST,
                    detail="You must confirm you want to delete this record by setting the 'confirm' parameter to 'Y'",
                )

        self.actions.delete = new_delete

        # 2. Provide a new route to an existing function (notice, no @ symbol!)
        self.controller.get(
            "/all",
            description="Another way to get many users",
            response_model=many_schema,
            response_model_exclude_none=True,
            dependencies=dependency_list(verify_session),
        )(self.actions.get_all)

        # 3. Re-use within your own function
        @self.controller.get(
            "/everything",
            description="Yet another way to get many users",
            response_model=many_schema,
            response_model_exclude_none=True,
            dependencies=dependency_list(verify_session),
        )
        async def get_all_again(
            page: int = 1,
            limit: int = 10,
            columns: list[str] = Query(None, alias="columns"),
            sort: list[str] = Query(None, alias="sort"),
            where: Json = Query(None, alias="where"),
        ):
            return await self.actions.get_all(
                page=page, limit=limit, columns=columns, sort=sort, where=where
            )

```

<!-- CruddyController -->

### CruddyController

The `CruddyController` is a base class with a single method `setup` that applications can leverage to "extend" the default CRUD route controllers as needed. This class is needed to control application flow during the resolution boot cycle, and to allow you to share methods between resources like a mixin. Controllers should generally be placed within a project folder named "controllers". Controller classes can be imported in your resource file, and passed to the resource at definition time. Don't worry, the `Resource` class will create a controller instance for you!

Example `my_app/controllers/User.py`:

```python
from fastapi import Depends
from fastapi_cruddy_framework import CruddyController, CruddyGenericModel
from my_app.policies.verify_session import verify_session

class HelloSchema(CruddyGenericModel):
    hello: str = "world"

class UserController(CruddyController):
    def setup(self):
        # You can extend controller actions here!
        # You can also access:
        # self.actions
        # self.resource
        # self.repository
        # self.adapter
        # self.controller
        @self.controller.get(
            "/hello", response_model=HelloSchema, dependencies=[Depends(verify_session)]
        )
        async def hello():
            return HelloSchema(hello="world")
```

Example Continued `my_app/resources/User.py`:

```python
from fastapi_cruddy_framework import Resource, UUID
from my_app.adapters import sqlite
from my_app.models.user import (
    User,
    UserCreate,
    UserUpdate,
    UserView,
)
from my_app.schemas.response import MetaObject
from my_app.controllers.user import UserController
from my_app.policies.verify_session import verify_session
from my_app.policies.hash_user_password import (
    hash_user_password,
)


resource = Resource(
    adapter=sqlite,
    response_schema=UserView,
    response_meta_schema=MetaObject,
    resource_update_model=UserUpdate,
    resource_create_model=UserCreate,
    resource_model=User,
    protected_relationships=["posts"],
    id_type=UUID,
    policies_universal=[verify_session],
    policies_create=[hash_user_password],
    controller_extension=UserController
)
```

Notice that you don't need to instantiate your controller!

`CruddyController` extension classes passed to the `Resource` definition will be `setup()` <i>BEFORE</i> the auto-generated CRUD routes but <i>AFTER</i> SQL Alchemy has resolved model relationships. This ensures that your user-defined routes receive priority for incoming HTTP requests. If extension classes were not loaded first, then the CRUD handlers would almost always intercept the incoming request first.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- ControllerConfigurator -->

### ControllerConfigurator

The `ControllerConfigurator` is a configuration function invoked by the `Resource` class after SQL Alchemy has resolved all model relationships. You shouldn't need to interact with this function, but if you're a super advanced user, or wunderkind, maybe you will find a reason to need this. In essence, this function builds out all of the basic CRUD logic for a resource, after the resource has constructed a repository and generated the shadow schemas for your models. This is where your CRUD routes and sub-routes are auto-magically configured.

The controller/router configured by each of your `Resource` objects will allow the base resource or its relationships to be queried from the client via an arbitrarily complex `where` object (JSON encoded query parameter).

Invalid attributes or ops are just dropped. (May change in the future)

Improvements that will be made in the near future:

1. Conditional table joins for relationships to...
2. Make resources searchable with joined relationships via dot notation in the `where` object!
3. Maybe throw an error if a bad search field is sent? (Will help UI devs)

Clients can build an arbitrarily deep query with a JSON dictionary, sent via a query parameter in a JSON object that generally contains all possible filter operators along with "and," "or," and "not" conditions.

Field level and boolean operators begin with a * character. This will nearly always translate down to the sqlalchemy level, where it is up to the model class to determine what operations are possible on each model attribute. The top level query of a `where` object is an implicit AND. To do an OR, the base key of the search must be `*or`, as in the below examples:

`/resource?where={"*or":{"first_name":"bilbo","last_name":"baggins"}}`

`/resource/{id}/relationship?where={"*or":{"first_name":{"*contains":"bilbo"},"last_name":"baggins"}}`

`/resource?where={"*or":{"first_name":{"*endswith":"bilbo"},"last_name":"baggins","*and":{"email":{"*contains":"@"},"first_name":{"*contains":"helga"}}}}`

`/resource?where={"*or":{"first_name":{"*endswith":"bilbo"},"last_name":"baggins","*and":[{"email":{"*contains":"@"}},{"email":{"*contains":"helga"}}]}}`

The following query would be an implicit \*and:

`/resource?where=[{"first_name":{"*endswith":"bilbo"}},{"last_name":"baggins"}]`

As would the following query:

`/resource/{id}/relationship?where={"first_name":{"*endswith":"bilbo"},"last_name":"baggins"}`

"Dot" notation is currently supported for JSON or JSON-like columns. The following queries showcase this:

`/resource?where={"user.config.favoriteColor":{"*eq":"black"}}`

`/resource?where={"favorites.":{"*contained_by":{"tags":["foo","bar","baz]}}}`

`/resource?where={"favorites.tags":{"*contains":["foo"]}}`

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- AbstractRepository -->

## AbstractRepository

The `AbstractRepository` is a helpful way to interact with the data layer of your models. It contains all of the underlying functions that the `Resource` and `Controller` objects use to query, create, update, and delete your database information. Each `Resource` you define will automatically create an `AbstractRepository` instance that manages it. This can be accessed in your application at `your_resource_instance.repository`. The methods available to you via this repository instance are:

```python
# User functions accessible from any resource's 'AbstractRepository'
async def create(data: CruddyModel)

async def get_by_id(id: UUID | int | str)

async def update(id: UUID | int | str, data: CruddyModel)

async def delete(id: UUID | int | str)

async def get_all(page: int = 1, limit: int = 10, columns: list[str] = None, sort: list[str] = None, where: Json = None)

async def get_all_relations(id: UUID | int | str = ..., relation: str = ..., relation_model: CruddyModel = ..., page: int = 1, limit: int = 10, columns: list[str] = None, sort: list[str] = None, where: Json = None)

async def set_many_many_relations(id: UUID | int | str, relation: str = ..., relations: list[UUID | int | str] = ...)

async def set_one_many_relations(id: UUID | int | str, relation: str = ..., relations: list[UUID | int | str] = ...)
```

Generally, these functions do about what you would expect them to do. More documentation will be added to describe their function soon. Please read nuances below, however, as it applies to how x-to-Many relationships are managed via the automatic CRUD routes.

<b>Important AbstractRepository Nuances</b>

- `set_many_many_relations` and `set_one_many_relations` both destroy and then re-create the x-to-Many relationships they target. If a `user` with the id of 1 was a member of `groups` 1, 2, and 3, then calling `await user_repository.set_many_many_relations(1, 'groups', [4,5,6])` would result in `user` 1 being a member of only groups 4,5, and 6 after execution. Client applications should be aware of this functionality, and always send ALL relationships that should still exist during any relational updates.

<!-- Validators / Checkers -->

## Validators / Checkers

`fastapi-cruddy-framework` includes validators and checkers useful to enrich your model definitions by exporting `field_checkers`, `field_validators`, and `field_errors` objects. These objects are all simple re-exports of the core `validators`, `checkers` and `errors` from [validator-collection](https://github.com/insightindustry/validator-collection/). For additional documentation on what is available, see that project's README.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- WebsocketConnectionManager -->

## WebsocketConnectionManager

`fastapi-cruddy-framework` includes a relatively full-featured `WebsocketConnectionManager` that offers many of the same features as other great websocket libraries, such as [socket.io](https://socket.io/). The easiest way to see the full capabilities of the websocket manager is to look at the example server used to test this library! For instance, [here](examples/fastapi_cruddy_sqlite/services/websocket_1.py) and [here](examples/fastapi_cruddy_sqlite/services/websocket_2.py) you can see how to instantiate a `WebsocketConnectionManager`. You can then bind an instance of a `WebsocketConnectionManager` to your `ApplicationRoute`, as seen [here](examples/fastapi_cruddy_sqlite/router/application.py), using the async context manager's `.connect()` function to initiate a bidirectional websocket context that supports broadcasts, rooms, direct socket-to-socket messages, kill commands, a custom socket identity hook (to identify or kill many sockets owned by the same user), and a horizontally scaling control plane where you can even plugin your own custom commands! Note that you need to `.startup()` and `.dispose()` of a `WebsocketConnectionManager` in your application's `lifespan` hook, as seen [here](examples/fastapi_cruddy_sqlite/main.py).


The `WebsocketConnectionManager` will receive more thorough documentation in the future when it becomes more stable, but it is fully tested in it's current state and is very reliable!


Note that currently the `WebsocketConnectionManager` requires `redis` to function. In the future, other broker types may be added as well! The pub/sub aspect is delegated to a separate class under the hood.

<!-- BrowserTestClient -->

## BrowserTestClient

The `BrowserTestClient` is a useful helper class to enable test suites to "boot" a Cruddy based app, and then use different virtual "browsers" to execute API tests against the app at the same time, against the same app instance. For usage examples, see `tests/conftest.py` and `tests/crud/*.py`. `BrowserTestClient` is designed to use the async ASGI server runner `TestClient`, which is re-exported from [async-asgi-testclient](https://github.com/vinissimus/async-asgi-testclient). Assuming your app has some level of authentication present you could setup your own conftest.py to look like:

```python
from logging import getLogger
from asyncio import get_event_loop_policy, sleep
from pytest import fixture, mark
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi_cruddy_framework import TestClient, BrowserTestClient

logger = getLogger(__name__)

FAKE_AUTH_TOKEN = "somefaketokenvalue"
FAKE_AUTH_QP = f"?auth_token={FAKE_AUTH_TOKEN}"
FAKE_AUTH_HEADERS = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {FAKE_AUTH_TOKEN}"}


@fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
def event_loop():
    loop = get_event_loop_policy().new_event_loop()
    yield loop
    loop.close()


@fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
@mark.asyncio
async def app():
    # Don't move this import!
    from your_app.main import app

    yield app


@fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
@mark.asyncio
async def client(app: FastAPI):
    # By using "with" the FastAPI app launch hook is run, connecting the application router
    async with TestClient(app, use_cookies=False) as client:
        while (await client.get("/health")).json() != True:
            await sleep(0.5)
        yield client


@fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
@mark.asyncio
async def unauthenticated_client(client: TestClient):
    blank_client = BrowserTestClient(client=client, cookies=None, headers=None)
    yield blank_client


@fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
@mark.asyncio
async def authenticated_client(client: TestClient):
    sessioned_client = BrowserTestClient(
        client=client, cookies=None, headers=FAKE_AUTH_HEADERS
    )
    await sessioned_client.get(f"/users/authorization{FAKE_AUTH_QP}")
    yield sessioned_client


@fixture(scope="function")
@mark.asyncio
async def authenticated_websocket(authenticated_client: BrowserTestClient):
    async with authenticated_client.websocket_connect("/ws") as websocket:
        # For example: data = await websocket.receive_json()
        # Or await websocket.send_json(data)
        # If your server sends any kind of "welcome" messages, make
        # sure you purge them here BEFORE yielding the socket back
        # to whatever function needs to run tests
        yield websocket

```

<!-- Where Queries -->

## Where Queries

Additional documentation will be added soon on complete functionality supported via the CRUD endpoint / AbstractRepository `where` parameter.

### NEW QUERY FEATURES

#### Column casting!


To cast a column to a different type during a query, send a where payload like one of the examples below.


A `tsvector` cast:
```python
where = {"column_name:tsvector:english": {"*websearch_to_tsquery": "foo or bar -baz"}}
```


The query stage's casting key name for `tsvector` should match the format `<column_name>:tsvector:<vector language>`.


`tsvector` is the most complicated form of casting, as it requires the cast type (tsvector) as well as the tsvector language (english, or another langauge) in the key definition.


`tsvector` then supports the following query operators at the next level: `*websearch_to_tsquery` and `*match`, both of which mirror the sqlalchemy docs regarding functionality.


To add a `tsvector` field to your cruddy data model, complete with proper indexing for performance, add the following to your table model class:


```python
# models/example.py
from typing import Any
from sqlmodel import Field, cast, func, Text
from sqlalchemy import Column, Index, literal_column
from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import JSONB, UUID as psqlUUID
from fastapi_cruddy_framework import  CruddyModel, CruddyCreatedUpdatedMixin, UUID, uuid7


class ExampleUpdate(CruddyModel):
    data: Any = Field(
        schema_extra={
            "examples": [
                {
                    "some": {
                        "key": "value"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    )


class ExampleCreate(ExampleUpdate):
    pass


class Example(CruddyCreatedUpdatedMixin(), ExampleCreate, table=True):  # type: ignore
    id: UUID =  Field(
        sa_column=Column(
            psqlUUID(as_uuid=True),
            primary_key=True,
            index=True,
            nullable=False,
            default=uuid7,
        )
    )
    data: Any = Field(
        default=None,
        sa_column=Column(JSONB, nullable=True, default=None),
    )
    __table_args__ = (
        Index("ix_Example_data_gin", "data", postgresql_using="gin"),
        Index('ix_Example_data_tsvector', func.to_tsvector(literal_column("'english'"), cast(data.sa_column, Text)), postgresql_using="gin"),
    )
```


A `Text` (or any other) cast:
```python
where = {"a_json_column_name:Text": {"*icontains": "some substring"}}
```


The query stage's casting key name should match the format `<column_name>:<cast type>`.


Generally cast types are straightforward and expect a query operator and input type that can be mapped to the column's casted type. Supported column cast types are:


```python
array
tsvector
BigInteger
Boolean
Date
DateTime
Double
Enum
Float
Integer
Interval
LargeBinary
MatchType
Numeric
SmallInteger
String
Text
Time
Unicode
UnicodeText
Uuid
ARRAY
BIGINT
BINARY
BLOB
BOOLEAN
CHAR
CLOB
DATE
DATETIME
DECIMAL
DOUBLE
DOUBLE_PRECISION
FLOAT
INT
INTEGER
JSON
NCHAR
NUMERIC
NVARCHAR
REAL
SMALLINT
TEXT
TIME
TIMESTAMP
UUID
VARBINARY
VARCHAR
```


#### Value casting!


Datetime value with timezone:
```python
where = {"datetime_column": {"*gt": {"*datetime": "2024-02-14T19:17:40.860657Z"}}}
```


Datetime value without timezone:
```python
where = {"datetime_column": {"*gt": {"*datetime_naive": "2024-02-14T19:17:40.860657Z"}}}
```
