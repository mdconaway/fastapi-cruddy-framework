### CreateRouterFromResources

This instance factory creates and returns a fully-wired fastapi `APIRouter` which sub-routes all `Resource` instances created in your project. Theoretically, you can create and mount multiple routers this way, but each router needs to be provided to all of the `Resource` instances required to fully resolve the relationships it may care about.

The recommended way to structure your project is to keep all resources required for a route set contained within a single folder. This factory is then provided the relative path to a resource set folder, starting with your application's `main` module, and will return the fully interconnected route set while also instantiating all of your resource modules.

Typically, it is a good idea to import all of your router instances in your main module, as they will need to be "connected" to your fastapi server <i>WITHIN</i> the `startup` hook. This is critical, as the resource registry (discussed below) cannot fully resolve relationships until after SQLAlchemy is aware of all models. This occurs in-between launching your main module and the `startup` hook.

Example:

```{ .python .annotate }
import my_app
from fastapi_cruddy_framework import CreateRouterFromResources
from fastapi import FastAPI, APIRouter


my_router: APIRouter = CreateRouterFromResources(
    # (REQUIRED) application_module is of "ModuleType" type, and should be a pointer to your main app module
    application_module=my_app,
    # (OPTIONAL) resource_path is of "str" type, and should specify a relative path from application_module
    # to the location of your "resources" that will be auto-loaded and bundled under this router
    # tree.
    resource_path="resources",
    # (OPTIONAL) common_resource_name is of "str" type, and should describe the common export value in each
    # resource file where the router factory can find your "Resource" instances. Use this if you want to name
    # all of your resource objects something other than "resource"
    common_resource_name="resource"
)

app = FastAPI(title="My App", version="1")

@app.on_event("startup")
async def bootstrap():
  app.include_router(my_router)

# fin!
```
